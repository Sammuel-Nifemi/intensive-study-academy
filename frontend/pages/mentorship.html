      <p>
        Private Mentorship is a structured support space designed to help students
        navigate academic pressure, personal growth, study discipline, and clarity
        around their educational journey.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is <strong>not a medical or therapeutic service</strong>.
        It focuses on guidance, accountability, and constructive discussion.
